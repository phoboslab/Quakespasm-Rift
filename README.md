## RiftQuake

[Download Here](https://github.com/swax/Quakespasm-Rift/releases)

This is a mod to the rift quakespasm mod by [@phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab)

Improvements:
* Minimal head movement. The center of the crosshair is always in front of your face. Moving your head looks around relative to the crosshair.
* More accurate. Only your mouse controls the crosshair. Moving you head does not change your aim.
* 3D Crosshair. Projected out in 3D space at whatever you're pointing at.
* Menus and console rendered in the 3D world.

Use ~ to access the console and type 'r_oculusrift 1' to activate the rift view. 

Enjoy,

PS Valve - Please make this 'vr_moveaim_mode 9' in tf2 :smile:
